# Web_Request_AND_Anti-Sandbox
This reposiorty contains the c# code which is using latest persistence technique and multiple anti-vm, anti-sandboxes techniques. In this program, I am using 4 anti-vm and anti-sanboxe techniques.

# Anti-Vm and Anti-Sandbox
1) Getting Ram size if it is less than 4 gb program will terminate.
2) Checking if the exe is running in VMware or VirtualBox it will terminate.
3) Checking the debuger is present, it will terminate.
4) Checking if the exe is running in sandbox it will terminate.
